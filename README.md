Building a slit spectrometer that uses a 300 line/mm grating. The goal is to perform stellar spectrometry at the focus of a small telescope. 

The project is based on the Sol'Ex project although Sol'Ex uses a reflection grating. I wanted to try to build one with a cheap transmission grating that can be found on Amazon or Ebay.

I'm trying to learn a little ray-tracing, so I've started to use Beam Four - an open source, Java-based ray-tracing program. I think that individuals can also use Zemax for free for a year, but I haven't tried that, yet.
